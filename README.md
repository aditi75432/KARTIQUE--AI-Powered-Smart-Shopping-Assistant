## 🧠 Agent System Overview

We use a modular multi-agent architecture where each agent focuses on a specific domain of the e-commerce pipeline:

| Agent Name             | Role                                                                 |
|------------------------|----------------------------------------------------------------------|
| `behavior_agent.js`    | Tracks user behavior, session patterns                               |
| `recommendation_agent.js` | Generates AI-powered product recommendations                      |
| `chatbot_agent.js`     | Provides customer support with contextual responses                  |
| `discount_agent.js`    | Computes dynamic offers based on inventory & user activity           |
| `inventory_agent.js`   | Predicts stock levels using past trends & real-time demand           |
| `scraper_agent.js`     | Scrapes market competitors' pricing & reviews for better decisions   |

> Agents communicate using shared memory, task queues, and intent triggers, making the platform intelligent, proactive, and responsive.
